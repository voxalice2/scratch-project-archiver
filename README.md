# scratch-project-archiver
Uses https://scratch-projects-v3.scratch.org/, https://scratch-projects-v2.scratch.org/, and https://scratch-projects.scratch.org/ to download Scratch projects in ascending order, automatically downgrading when a download fails.
These APIs are used because they allow *all* projects to be downloaded, not just shared projects.
